// The @extend directive lets you share a set of CSS properties from one selector to another.
// The @extend directive is useful if you have almost identically styled elements that only differ in some small details.
// The @extend directive is used to share styles between selectors. Itâ€™s important to note that the @extend directive should only be used when you want to share styles between two selectors that have a lot in common.
