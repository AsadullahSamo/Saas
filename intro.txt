- Saas is compiled to CSS through Compilers like Koala or extensions like live Saas compiler
because browsers understand CSS not Saas
- Partials can be used to part multiple files and then import them. All partials filenames should start with "_"
Like, we made 
	_header.scss	_menu.scss	_footer.scss
and then import them in style.scss like (syntax: @import "path‚Äù)
	@import "header"
	@import "menu"
	@import "footer"
